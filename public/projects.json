    "description": "The **backend** of the website is being built using **Java** and **Spring Boot**. It acts as a **CMS (Content Management System)**, allowing easy management of content such as projects, photography, and blog posts. Key components include:\n- **Content management** for dynamic updates to project details, portfolio images, and blog content.\n- **Database integration** using **MySQL** for storing information about projects, photography galleries, and more.\n- **AWS** for storing static content, and perhaps part of secrets - in combo with **Hashicorp**.\n- **APIs** that serve project details and photography content to the frontend.\n\n ---\n\n#### **Next Steps for Backend**\n- **Full implementation**\n- **Enhance CMS capabilities**: Adding more flexible content management options, including media uploads and rich text formatting.\n- **Improve API functionality**: Expanding the API to support more dynamic content retrieval and filtering.\n- **Optimize performance**: Fine-tuning database queries and implementing caching strategies to improve load times.\n",

    "description": "In this project, I was part of the Experimentation Team for a TV on-demand platform, where we worked on enhancing user engagement through feature flags. Our goal was to improve the user experience by testing different features and measuring their impact.\n\nWe would take a working **microservice** and create a **feature flag** (using **Java** and **Spring Boot**), which was then applied to a selected group of viewers using **Optimizely**. These viewers (bucketed into different groups) would interact with the new feature, and we’d track metrics like **view events** to see if the feature led to an increase or decrease in engagement.\n\nMy role in the team included:\n- Writing **code** to implement new features and changes.\n- Performing **peer code reviews** to maintain high-quality code.\n- Writing **tests** to ensure stability and reliability of the features.\n- **Deploying** the code to the cloud using **Jenkins, AWS,** and **Apigee** to make sure everything ran smoothly and efficiently.",
